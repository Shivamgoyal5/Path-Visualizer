## 🧰 Features

- 🔹 **Start & Target Points**  
  Easily set the starting and destination positions on the grid.

- 🔹 **Bricks (Walls)**  
  Add impassable blocks to simulate obstacles in the grid.

- 🔹 **Weights**  
  Apply different weights to cells to simulate variable traversal costs (useful for Dijkstra’s & A*).

- 🔹 **Algorithms Supported**
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
  - **BDS (Bidirectional Search)**
  - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
  - **A* Search Algorithm**

- 🔹 **Erase Tool**  
  Erase bricks, weights, or positions when needed.

- 🔹 **Reset Grid**  
  Reset the grid to its initial empty state with one click.

- 🔹 **Run Multiple Algorithms**  
  Simultaneously run more than one algorithm for performance comparison.

- 🔹 **Export Grid**  
  Export your grid setup as `.png`, `.jpeg`, or `.pdf`.

- 🔹 **Print Metrics**  
  View side-by-side comparisons of all algorithms:
  - Number of steps
  - Execution time
  - Path cost (if applicable)

- 🔹 **User Guide**  
  Built-in interactive help that explains how to use each feature.
